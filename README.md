# PowerBI-Leads-Analysis
Power BI dashboards for lead segmentation and prioritization
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing leads data to identify high-value prospects and create a clear prioritization strategy. The goal is to help sales and marketing teams target the right companies, improve engagement, and maximize lead conversion

# Business Problem
Leads were scattered across multiple categories without clear prioritization. This made it difficult for sales teams to decide which prospects to pursue first, leading to:
Wasted effort on low-value leads
Missed opportunities with strategic accounts
Lack of clarity on follow-up actions

# Data Description
The dataset includes:
Company Name
Lead Category (Send Info, Query, Active)
Email Availability (Yes/No)
Headcount (Company size)
Duration passed 

# Approach & Methodology
Segmented leads into categories (Send Info, Query, Active).
Checked email availability to separate reachable vs. less reachable leads.
Classified companies by headcount to identify high-value/enterprise accounts.
Designed a Power BI dashboard to visualize insights and support decision-making.

# Key Insights
80â€“88% of leads have valid emails, indicating a strong opportunity for direct outreach.
Cold leads (Send Info, Query) require consistent nurturing (follow-ups, calls, information sharing).
Larger companies (high headcount) represent higher ROI prospects and should be prioritized.
Leads without emails are less engaged, resulting in a lower immediate priority.

# Business Impact / Recommendations
Prioritize outreach to larger companies with verified email access.
Nurture cold leads with regular engagement to build trust and interest.
Defer low-engagement leads (no email) until higher-value prospects are addressed.
